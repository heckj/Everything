# Everything

Literally everything

This repository and Swift Package is ~~where my Swift source code goes to die~~ a collection of various small functions and types that don't really merit the overhead of me creating and maintaining their own repository.

You probably should not link to this Swift Package directly as I make no guarantees about backwards compatibility. Instead I suggest you copy and paste the code from this repository into yours if you find any part of it useful.
